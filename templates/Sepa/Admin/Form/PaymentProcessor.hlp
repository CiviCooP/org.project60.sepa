{htxt id='extra_advance_days'}
  <p>{ts}The SEPA DD Rulebook specifies how many banking days (more precisely, TARGET inter-bank days) in advance (before the due date) a collection has to be presented to the debtor bank at the latest. However, many (all?) creditor banks need an additional banking day to process the collections before presenting them to the debtor bank.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}If you know that your (creditor) bank doesn't need that extra day, specify 0 here; otherwise, leave it at the default of 1. (Larger numbers are also possible, in case some bank needs even more than one day.) If you are unsure, check with your bank.{/ts}</p>
