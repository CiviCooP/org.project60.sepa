# SEPA-Basics

We will only cover some selected and relevant aspects of SEPA as the whole matter is very complex and many much more comprehensive compendia have been written about it already. For some countries that have been using Direct Debit (DD) Payments regularly before (such as Germany), SEPA made things worse as it is more complicated than the old systems â€“ both in regard to technical issues and the workflow of handling the payments. On top of that, is spite of a year-long process of developing a common SEPA-standard, many countries and sometimes even banks have their own exceptions or special rules.

Thus CiviSEPA was build in a way to be as adaptable as possible in order to deal with all those requirements that will most likely differ from organisation to organisation.

## Involved Parties

You can initiate two types of SEPA Direct Debits:

- one-off (OOFF)
- recurring (RCUR)
