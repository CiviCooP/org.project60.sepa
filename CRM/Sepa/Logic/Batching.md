# Batching Logic

## General principles

Batching will occur in a waterfall model, ie. every SDD contribution created should be batched immediately, and the subsequent levels of batching would be triggered automatically. (Post) hooks would be used to trigger that.

## First level of batching

The first level of batching is called a **SEPA transaction group** (TXG).
TXG unites contributions which share
 
* a same type (FRST, RCUR or OOFF)
* a same `sdd_creditor` (identified by a common payment_instrument_id)
* a same collection date (`receive_date` is used for that)

Conditions (a) and (b) are 'hard' conditions, but (c) gives us a bit of leeway. Imagine the following calendar (# indicates a bank work day, *blank* a non-working day) :
   
&nbsp; |  #  |  #  |  #  |  &nbsp;  |  &nbsp;  |  #  |  #  |  #  |  #  |  #  |  &nbsp;  
:----- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: 
TXG collection date | | | | | | * |  | | | | 
SepaTx #1 already in the TXG | | | | | | * | | | | | 
Earlier SepaTx  | | | *| | | | | | | | 
Later SepaTx  | | | | | | | | | * | | 

As a rule, we will assume that

1. we will never speed up collection of a TX (by placing it in a batch with an earlier collection date) by **more than MAXPULL days**
2. we will never delay collection of a TX (by placing it in a batch with a later collection date) by **more than MAXPUSH days**

> The MAXPULL, MAXPUSH parameters will have to be set in a general configuration, most likely per creditor (can be added to its config blob).

### Creating a TXG

The TXG collection date will decide on the actual collection. Typically, the TXG **last possible submission date** is `collection date - delay` (5 for FRST or OOFF, 2 for RCUR) - 1 working day. Hence, the logic for calculating the collection date when creating a TXG is

	submission_date = latest( today, tx.collection_date - delay - 1 )
	effective_collection_date = submission_date + delay + 1

This puts a limit on the earliest tx that we can put in the batch. A tx with an **earlier** intended collection date will be collected later. If we add  a tx with a **later** intended collection date, it will simply be collected earlier. 

Finding an appropriate TXG for a contribution hence means finding a TXG with same type and creditor, and with an effective collection date within [MAXPULL, MAXPUSH] of the contribution's intended collection date.

## Second level of batching

The second and final of batching is called an **SDD file** most commonly referred to as the **XML file**. In reality, every SDD file will correspond to an XML format of it. 

### Closing a TXG

As indicated before, a TXG has a 'send before' date defined by the `earliest collection date - delay - 1`. At that time, the TXG needs to be closed and no more contributions can be added. The SDD file it belongs to will also be closed and marked for sending. 

Any other contribution with a collection date compatible with this TXG will cause another TXG to be created, but this one will have the earliest collection date indicated earlier.


## Determining collection dates

Controlling collection dates is one of the most important elements of using SDD. This can happen at various levels :

* (for recurring contributions) setting contribution_recur.cycle_day
* setting contribution.receive_date
* manipulating the collection dates of TXG and SDD Files.
